# Daigaku Database

[daigakudatabase.com](https://daigakudatabase.com) is a website for students to easily search colleges and universities in the
U.S. and get useful information.

## Motivation

I first created bulk of the website in spring 2021 while as a project to learn web development and data visualization. After a year, I decided to revisit the project and give it some much needed updates, as well as adding new features and brushing up old ones while I was at it.
